The following observations have been made regarding 
Quantum algorithms:
1) We tend to pass in uniform superposition made 
   using H
2) Oracles are capable of verification of solution 
   though not of search. Also for oracles, O^2 = I and 
   so they are self adjoint.
3) We generally pass in a non-1 eigenvalued 
   Eigenvector of the oracle as the qubit to which
   the oracle xors the output. This allows for phase
   kickback. Oracles may also be used to create a
   entanglement by binding some states to |0> and
   others to |1> allowing for creation of specific
   states by subsequent measurement of the auxilary
   qubit.
4) It is better to represent superposition states as 
   Tensor products.
5) Quantum security algorithms exploit no cloning
   theorem and entanglement. 
6) Quantum communication algorithms exploit entanglement 
   The reason behind use of entanglement is the ability
   to manipulate a 2 qubit system while possessing only
   1 qubit.
