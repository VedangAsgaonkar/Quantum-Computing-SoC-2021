The following observations have been made regarding 
Quantum algorithms:
1) We tend to pass in uniform superposition made 
   using H
2) Oracles are capable of verification of solution 
   though not of search
3) We generally pass in a non-1 eigenvalued 
   Eigenvector of the oracle as the qubit to which
   the oracle xors the output. This allows for phase
   kickback 
4) It is better to represent superposition states as 
   Tensor products 
5) Quantum security algorithms exploit no cloning
   theorem and entanglement 
6) Quantum communication algorithms exploit entanglement 
   The reason behind use of entanglement is the ability
   to manipulate a 2 qubit system while possessing only
   1 qubit
