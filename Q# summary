No references or pointers are present

QUANTUM DATA TYPES:
1)Qubit : represents a single qubit. The Qubit s can be alterred only by operations. They can be passed to 
            functions, though they cannot be alterred there. In operations, they are alterred by a standard
            set of operations.
2)Pauli : 4 types PauliI , PauliX , PauliY , PauliZ . They represent a single qubit pauli gate. Mainly used
          to represent the basis of measurement.
3)Result : It specifies the result of a single qubit measurement in terms of the eigenvalue that was measured.
            0 indicates eigenvalue 1 = (-1)^0 was measured. 1 indicates eigenvalue -1 = (-1)^1 was measured.

CREATING CLASSICAL VARIABLES IN Q#
1)let : It creates immutable variables. Eg: let x = 1 ;
2)mutable: It creates mutable variables. Eg: mutable x = 1 ;
3)set: It alters mutable variables. Eg: set x = x + 1 ;

COMMENTS:
Only single line comments are allowed. 
// comments give single line comments
/// gives markdown documentation comments

CONDITIONALS:
Written as follows:
    if x==1 {
    //code
    }
    elif x > 3 {
    //code
    }
    else{
    //code
    }
    
ITERATIONS:
The for loop is used to iterate over the elements of an array or in a range. The loop
variable is immutable in code and local to the loop

for qubit in array_of_qubits{
    //code
}

for x in 0 .. 9 { // the .. operator is a both ends inclusive range
    //code
}

for x in 0 .. Length(array_of_qubits)-1{
    //code
}
    

CLASSICAL OPERATORS:
+ - * / % > < >= <= == != and or not ?: += -= *= /= %=
Additionaly the following are defined:
1) Copy and update:
    A w/ B <- C
    This returns the object A with its member B updated as C
    w/ is like a short form for "with"
    There is also a shorthand
    A w/= B<-C
    meaning
    A = A w/ B <- C
    
    The operator can also be used to manipulate a particular element or index of an array
    For eg:
    arr w/= 0 <- 3 means replace the element at index 0 with the number 3

2) Range:
    Written as start .. step .. stop
    Start is always inclusive. Stop is inclusive if it is possible to reach it from start by step sized steps
    We can also write start .. stop meaning step=1

FUNCTIONS:
They represent purely deterministic behaviour. They are capable of performing classical operations. They can take qubits
as input, but they cannot alter them, nor call quantum operators.
