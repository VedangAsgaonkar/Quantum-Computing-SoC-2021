CREATING CLASSICAL VARIABLES IN Q#
1)let : It creates immutable variables. Eg: let x = 1 ;
2)mutable: It creates mutable variables. Eg: mutable x = 1 ;
3)set: It alters mutable variables. Eg: set x = x + 1 ;

COMMENTS:
Only single line comments are allowed. 
// comments give single line comments
/// gives markdown documentation comments

CONDITIONALS:
Written as follows:
    if x==1 {
    //code
    }
    elif x > 3 {
    //code
    }
    else{
    //code
    }
    
ITERATIONS:
The for loop is used to iterate over the elements of an array or in a range. The loop
variable is immutable in code and local to the loop

for qubit in array_of_qubits{
    //code
}

for x in 0 .. 9 { // the .. operator is a both ends inclusive range
    //code
}

for x in 0 .. Length(array_of_qubits)-1{
    //code
}
